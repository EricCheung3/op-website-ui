## On-going Development Process ##
The master branch is for production release, and for each developer, we are all working on
release branch, such as release1, release2, etc.


So we need to switch to development branch, such as release1:

```
git checkout release1
```

After you have done code changes, you first need to commit it, for example:
```
git add .
git commit -m 'my code change for issue-31'
```

Then you merge with remote release branch, then push the changes:

```
git pull
git push
```

If `git pull` return merge error, you need to manually fix the merge conflict, before push.
